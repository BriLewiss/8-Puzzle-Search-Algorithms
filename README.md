# 8-Puzzle-Search-Algorithms
This project solves a 3x3 puzzle filled with the numbers 0-8. An initial state is generated at the start of the run, and the goal is for the search algorithm to reach the goal state. At the end of the run, it is printed to the terminal how many nodes were visited and how long it took to reach the goal state. The search algorithms used are Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, Best First Search, and A* Search.
